Installation:
Most Python libraries can be installed using pip (Python package manager):
pip install library_name

For example:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Virtual Environments:
It's recommended to use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies:
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
myenv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
