Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code into objects and classes.

Classes and Objects:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} is barking!"

# Create an object
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy is barking!

Attributes and Methods:
- Attributes: Variables that belong to an object (self.name, self.breed)
- Methods: Functions that belong to a class (def bark(self))

Inheritance:
Classes can inherit properties and methods from parent classes:

class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

Encapsulation:
Hide internal implementation details using private attributes (prefixed with _):
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self._balance = balance  # Private attribute
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self._balance += amount

Polymorphism:
Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common base class:

animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Bird()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())  # Each has its own speak() method

Special Methods:
Python classes can define special methods starting and ending with __ (dunder methods):
- __init__: Constructor, called when object is created
- __str__: String representation of object
- __repr__: Official string representation
- __len__: Length of object
- __add__: Addition operator overloading

Best Practices:
- Use descriptive class and method names
- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility
- Use inheritance to share common functionality
- Document your classes with docstrings
