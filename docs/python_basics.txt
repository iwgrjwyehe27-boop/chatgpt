Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple and readable syntax. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features of Python:
- Simple and readable syntax that emphasizes code readability
- Dynamically typed (no need to declare variable types)
- Supports multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional)
- Extensive standard library with modules for various tasks
- Interpreted language that runs on multiple platforms

Data Types:
Python supports several built-in data types:
- Integers: whole numbers like 42, -10, 0
- Floats: decimal numbers like 3.14, -2.5
- Strings: text data enclosed in quotes like "hello"
- Lists: ordered collections like [1, 2, 3, "hello"]
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs like {"name": "John", "age": 30}
- Tuples: immutable lists like (1, 2, 3)
- Sets: unordered collections like {1, 2, 3}

Variables and Assignment:
Variables are created by assigning a value using the equals sign:
x = 10
name = "Alice"
items = [1, 2, 3]

Control Flow:
Python uses indentation to define code blocks:
- if/elif/else statements for conditional execution
- for loops for iterating over sequences
- while loops for repeating code while a condition is true

Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code defined with the def keyword:
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

Comments:
Single-line comments start with # and explain code
Multi-line comments use triple quotes """ """
